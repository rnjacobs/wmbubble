    Fix for FreeBSD CPU usage problem under high load

Sun 25 Feb 2001 - 1.22
    Fixed segfault which occured under certain low memory conditions, found

    Released version 1.22

Sat 10 Mar 2001 - 1.23
    Patch from Dan Price to fix Shift Key detection on all platforms
    Tracked down another segfault related to off-by-one-scanline error
    Increased bm.bubblebuf allocation because bubbles created at the very
    bottom of the "water" are drawn outside of 56x56 region.
    Released version 1.23

Fri 16 Mar 2001 - 1.3
    Fixed load average graph - I don't know what the hell I was doing that
    it worked before, but the way the code was written it was never supposed
    to work :)
    Added some contributed code to hopefully catch most of bubble-related
    segfaults.  Thanks to "John H. Robinson, IV" <jaqque@ucsd.edu>
    Updated Makefile to use proper libs when linking with gdk, etc.  Should
    stop complaints about "missing library dependencies"
    This is a recommented upgrade if you use bubblemon version 1.2 or newer.
    Released version 1.3

Sat 14 Apr 2001 - 1.31
    FreeBSD machines were compiling bubblemon as "big-endian", resulting in
    fairly weird looking color problem.  This has been fixed :)  Minor change
    to Makefile.FreeBSD to put bubblemon in /usr/X11R6 during install.
    Released version 1.31

Mon 16 Apr 2001 - 1.32
    Important security update for FreeBSD - previous versions did not drop
    kmem privileges, and programs started by clicking on the dockapp were
    started with elevated privileges.  This is a required upgrade for FreeBSD
    users.

Tue 28 Aug 2001 - 1.4
    Added OpenBSD support. Thanks to Peter Stromberg <wilfried@openbsd.org>.

Wed  1 Oct 2003 - 1.41
    Added support for Linux kernel 2.6
    Fixed 101% cpu usage problem on kernel 2.6

Thu 13 May 2004 - 1.45
    Added support for NetBSD. Thanks to Metalhead <metalhead@metalhead.ws>
    This support is untested, use Makefile.NetBSD to compile.

Sat 15 May 2004 - 1.46
    Compile fix for FreeBSD-5.x, forgotten include.

Sat 03 Sep 2011 - 1.50
    Add calendar, digital and analog clocks. Dropped gdk for Ximage. Make
    border half-transparent instead of solid. Use Xresources instead of
    Xdefaults. Almost everything is now customizable at run time, and all
    the build-time customizations have been removed.

Mon 28 Jul 2014 - 1.51
    Fixes from Doug Torrance for working on modern FreeBSD, and add Makefile
    rules to build on Debian GNU/kFreeBSD.

Mon 1 Dec 2014 - 1.52
    Accept patches to omit various compilation warnings; use C99 format
    specifiers; explicitly handle system() failing (as unlikely as that
    is); update man page.
    Additionally, FreeBSD has long since had a way to get the memory status
    without being setgid, so jettison that scariness.

Wed 18 Feb 2015 - 1.53
    Don't update the display if we're not visible; if the screen is locked
    this should reduce cpu time taken to 1/3-1/2 of original.
    Also fix oversight where we weren't using the acclerated (abstraction
     breaking) RGB24->RGB32 blitter
